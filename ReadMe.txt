Web_DS is a showcase hub for my web development stuff.  This hub will hold my web projects as well as my understanding of various 
online tutorial materials.  I will be labling these as 'Building Block' items as they will be used as examples for building my actual applications.

Inside each build block project I will post a link to the tutorial that helped me make my building block project.

Thank you,
Pete
