This is just a sample game of snake with an added element of random bombs, the original snake code was inspired from this tutorial here:

The game is played similar to classic snake but with an addition to a timed bomb on the field of play.  If the snake hits the bomb its game over; however, if the timer runs out then the cells are reset.
